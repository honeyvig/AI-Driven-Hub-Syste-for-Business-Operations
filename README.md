Background: We are a specialized marketing agency. Our team delivers services across branding, advertising, and digital media. This role does not require direct client interaction. Instead, your focus will be on building/refining the operational backbone that powers our business.

We are designing a centralized "hub" system, integrating modern AI tools (like GPT and Gemini) with platforms like Google Workspace, Slack, and Zapier, to revolutionize our internal processes. This role will include:

--Hub Development: Building and programming features such as AI-powered email summarization, task management, calendar syncing, and document collaboration.
--AI-Driven Automations: Proactively identifying ways to use AI to streamline workflows, create insights, and enhance efficiency (e.g., auto-generated reports, creative suggestions).
--Platform Integrations: Connecting and optimizing tools like Zapier for seamless communication between systems (email, chat, task management, CRM).
--Ongoing Innovation: Staying consistently dialed into new AI developments and proactively proposing how emerging technologies can improve our operations.

Qualifications
--Strong familiarity with the AI landscape, including experience with GPT, Gemini, and similar platforms.
--Advanced experience with automation tools like Zapier.
--Proven programming skills, with a focus on building and integrating custom solutions.
--Exceptional organizational and problem-solving skills, with a track record of implementing tech solutions that drive measurable improvements.
--Ability to work independently, communicate effectively, and deliver quality results on time.

Here’s an overview of the kind of features and solutions we’re envisioning:
--AI-powered email summarization and drafting tools to streamline communication.

-------------
To develop a robust, AI-driven hub system for your business operations, we need to create a backend that integrates AI tools like GPT and Gemini with Google Workspace, Slack, Zapier, and other platforms to streamline communication, task management, and collaboration. Below is a Python-based framework for building the key features you've outlined, with an emphasis on integration, automation, and AI-driven insights.
Tech Stack:

    Backend: Python (Flask or Django)
    AI: OpenAI (GPT) for summarization, creative suggestions, and insights.
    Integrations: Google Workspace APIs, Slack API, Zapier (via webhooks), and external advertising platforms.
    Automation: Zapier, custom scripts.
    Task Management: Use Google Calendar API for syncing tasks and events.
    Document Collaboration: Google Drive API, Google Docs/Slides API.

# Endpoint to handle AI-driven email summarization
@app.route("/summarize_email", methods=["POST"])
def summarize():
    email_content = request.json.get('email_content')

    return jsonify({"doc_link": doc_link})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Key Features:

    AI-powered email summarization: Summarize incoming emails to extract actionable points using GPT.
    Task management: Sync tasks with Google Calendar using the Google Calendar API.
    Slack notifications: Send notifications to Slack channels when tasks or updates are required.
    Google Docs Integration: Create Google Docs automatically with templated content for things like proposals or reports.

Step 3: Platform Integrations via Zapier

    Zapier Integration: Use Zapier to automate workflows between the platforms.
        Example Zaps:
            Trigger: New task in Google Calendar → Action: Send a Slack notification.
            Trigger: New email received → Action: Summarize email via OpenAI GPT.
            Trigger: Create a new document in Google Drive → Action: Send an email or Slack message with document link.

    Zapier Webhooks: Use webhooks to integrate other systems via REST APIs. For example, if you use a project management tool like Asana, you can use Zapier to send data to your Flask backend and trigger automated actions.

Step 4: Ongoing Innovation & AI-driven Automations

As your operations scale, you’ll continuously monitor AI advancements (e.g., new GPT models, Gemini features) and integrate them into the hub system. Here are some potential improvements:

    Auto-generated Reports: Automatically generate weekly/monthly reports based on project or task data.
    AI Insights: Use AI to analyze project data and suggest process optimizations.
    Workflow Automation: Implement more complex workflows in Zapier that can integrate with your CRM, marketing tools, and data analytics platforms.
    Creative Suggestions: Use AI tools to provide creative feedback and suggestions based on the type of project or campaign you're working on.

Step 5: Future Enhancements

    Voice Interface: Add voice integration to allow task management via voice commands (via Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, or custom tools).
    Advanced AI Features: Implement natural language understanding to help automate and suggest creative ideas for marketing and branding.
    Real-time Collaboration: Enable real-time collaborative document editing using Google Drive and Slack for team coordination.

Conclusion:

This system will streamline the internal operations of your marketing agency using AI-powered automation, integrations with Google Workspace, Slack, and Zapier, and custom-built solutions to enhance task management, reporting, and collaboration. The backend, built in Python with Flask, provides a flexible foundation that can be extended with more AI-driven features as your agency grows.
